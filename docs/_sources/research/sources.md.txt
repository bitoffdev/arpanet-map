## BBN Status Reports

Starting with RFC235 (which was re-issued with corrections as RFC240), BBN
reported on the status of most Network Hosts approximately once every two
weeks.

- RFC 235
- RFC 240
- RFC 344
- RFC 353
- RFC 362
- RFC 366
- RFC 367
- RFC 370
- RFC 376

The last status report to be issued was RFC 376, on 8 August 1972:

> NOTE: Ellen Westheimer left BBN to return to school on August 4.
> We therefore will discontinue the publication of these summaries.
> It is my understanding that UCLA-NMC is considering the publica-
> tion of similar, although more detailed, survey data in the near
> future; I hope that data will serve in lieu of these reports.  In
> addition, of course, MIT-DMCG has had survey information available
> on line for some time (see RFC #308, NIC 9259.)
