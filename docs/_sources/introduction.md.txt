## Background

During my Fall 2019 semester of college, I became particularly interested in
one of the most significant predecessors to the internet as we know it today.

I wanted to make a visualization of how Arpanet changed over the years.

When picking a format to represent the data, I didn't find a schema that
perfectly suited my needs, so I decided to write my own using SQL. However,
there are other great formats that suit various needs for me. For example,
GeoJSON is great for displaying geographical data. GeoJSON integrates with
Leaflet.js and other front-end frameworks to display maps with minimal work.
For this reason, I have written scripts to build GeoJSON from my SQL schema.
Some data is lost, but this is for display only, so it's okay. The master copy
of the data is still stored via SQL.
